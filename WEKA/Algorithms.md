### Regression
Question: "How much should we charge for the new BMW M5?" Regression models can answer a question with a numerical answer. A regression model would use past sales data on BMWs and M5s to determine how much people paid for previous cars from the dealership, based on the attributes and selling features of the cars sold. The model would then allow the BMW dealership to plug in the new car's attributes to determine the price.

*Example: Selling Price = $25,000 + ($2900 * Liters in Engine) + ($9000 * isSedan) + ($11,000 * isConvertible) + ($100 * inches of car) + ($22,000 * isM).*

### Classification
Question: "How likely is person X to buy the newest BMW M5?" By creating a classification tree (a decision tree), the data can be mined to determine the likelihood of this person to buy a new M5. Possible nodes on the tree would be age, income level, current number of cars, mariatl status, kids, homeowner, or renter. The attributes of this person can be used against the decision tree to determine the likelihood of him purchasing the M5.

### Clustering
Question: "What age groups like the silver BMW M5?" The data can be mined to compare the age of the purchaser of past cars and the colors bought in the past. 

From this data, it could be found whether certain age groups (22-30 year olds, for example) have a higher propensity to order a certain color of BMW M5s (75 percent buy blue). Similarly, it can be shown that a different age group (55-62, for example) tend to order silver BMWs (65 percent buy silver, 20 percent buy gray). The data, when mined, will tend to cluster around certain age groups and certain colors, allowing the user to quickly determine patterns in the data.

### Nearest neighbor
Question: "When people purchase the BMW M5, what other options do they tend to buy at the same time?" The data can be mined to show that when people come and purchase a BMW M5, they also tend to purchase the matching luggage. (This is also known as basket analysis). 

Using this data, the car dealership can move the promotions for the matching luggage to the front of the dealership, or even offer a newspaper ad for free/discounted matching luggage when they buy the M5, in an effort to increase sales.
