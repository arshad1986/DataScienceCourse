MOA is an open-source framework software that allows to build and run experiments of machine learning or data mining on evolving data streams. It includes a set of learners and stream generators that can be used from the Graphical User Interface (GUI), the command-line, and the Java API. MOA contains several collections of machine learning algorithms:

These algorithms are designed for large scale machine learning, dealing with concept drift, and big data streams in real time.

MOA supports bi-directional interaction with Weka (machine learning). MOA is free software released under the GNU GPL.
