KNIME
=======
The Konstanz Information Miner, is a visual platform for graphically building and editing workflows and data analysis pipelines from defined components called nodes. KNIME is developed by Prof. Michael Berthold at the University of Konstanz, Germany.
It can be downloaded for free from www.knime.org .

KNIME is built on the Eclipse Interactive Development Environment and written in Java.
Versions are available for Windows, Linux and now the Macintosh. Another unique aspect to the KNIME workflow program is
the emphasis on chemistry and chemoinformatics through the incorporation of the CDK Chemistry project.

The standard data analysis and file manipulation tools that are distributed with KNIME include:
- I/O nodes to read and write data from files and databases
- Data manipulation nodes to manage data in tables, like joining, filtering, partitioning, etc
- Plotting and chart tools
- Statistics and data mining tools, like clustering and machine learning
