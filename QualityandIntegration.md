Data quality is the reliability and effectiveness of data, particularly in a data warehouse. 
Data quality assurance (DQA) is the process of verifying the reliability and effectiveness of data. 
Maintaining data quality requires going through the data periodically and scrubbing it. 
Typically this involves updating it, standardizing it, and de-duplicating records to create a 
single view of the data, even even if it is stored in multiple disparate systems. 
There are many vendor applications on the market to make this job easier.
Because data quality is so important from a business perspective, many large companies 
employ a data steward to be in charge of data quality. 

In spite of this, Gartner Inc. forecasted that 25% of critical data within Fortune 1000 
companies would continue to be inaccurate through 2007. A Gartner study says that poor quality 
customer data costs U.S. business an estimated $611 billion dollars a year 
in postage, printing, and staff overhead.
