A data set containing a large number of observed variables can be considered in the context of a number of latent variables that contain the "true" information in the data set.

The true number of latent variables can not easily be determined. Technique such as eigenvalue-one or scree plots can be used to guess. 

Principal components (otherwise known as factors) are used to represent these latent variables.
