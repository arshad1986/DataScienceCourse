\section{Number of Extracted Components }
\textit{(Continuing from 7 question questionnaire example.)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The preceding section may have created the impression
	that, if a principal component analysis were performed on data from the 7-item job satisfaction
	questionnaire, only two components would be created.  However, such an impression would not
	be entirely correct.
	
	\item \textbf{Important:} Correctly, the actual number of components extracted in a principal component analysis \textbf{\emph{is equal}} to the
	number of observed variables being analyzed.  This means that an analysis of the 7-item
	questionnaire would actually result in seven components, not two.
	
	\item 	However, in most analyses, only the first few components account for meaningful amounts of
	variance, so only these first few components are retained, interpreted, and used in subsequent
	analyses (such as in multiple regression analyses).  \\ For example, in your analysis of the 7-item
	job satisfaction questionnaire, it is likely that only the first two components would account for a
	meaningful amount of variance; therefore only these would be retained for interpretation.
	\item  You
	would assume that the remaining five components accounted for only trivial amounts of
	variance.  These latter components would therefore be discarded.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Determining the Number of Meaningful Components to Retain}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 

\textbf{Important:} You decide just how many of these components are truly
meaningful and worthy of being retained for further analysis.


\item In general, you expect
that only the first few components will account for meaningful amounts of variance, and that the
later components will tend to account for only trivial variance.


\item The next step of the analysis, therefore , is to determine how many meaningful components should be retained for
interpretation.  


\item The followings section will describe four criteria that may be used in making this decision:
\begin{enumerate} 
	\item the scree test,
	\item the eigenvalue-one criterion,  
	\item the proportion of variance accounted for, 
	\item the interpretability criterion.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Selection Techniques}
\subsection{The Scree Test} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item With the \textbf{Scree Test} \textit{(Cattell, 1966)}, you plot the eigenvalues associated with
	each component and look for a break between the components with relatively large
	eigenvalues and those with small eigenvalues.
	
%	\subsection*{Scree Test} Plotting the eigenvalues against the
%	corresponding PC produces a scree plot that illustrates
%	the rate of change in the magnitude of the eigenvalues
%	for the PC. The rate of decline tends to be fast first then
%	levels off. The \textit{\textbf{elbow}}, or the point at which the curve
%	bends, is considered to indicate the maximum number
%	of PC to extract. One less PC than the number at the
%	elbow might be appropriate if you are concerned about
%	getting an overly defined solution.
%	
	\item   The components that appear before the break are
	assumed to be meaningful and are retained for analysis; those apppearing after the break are
	assumed to be unimportant and are not retained.
	
	\item \textbf{Remark:} The word ``scree" refers to the loose rubble that lies at
	the base of a cliff.  When performing a scree test, you normally hope that the scree plot
	will take the form of a cliff:  At the top will be the eigenvalues for the few meaningful
	components, followed by a break (the edge of the cliff).  At the bottom of the cliff will lie
	the scree:  eigenvalues for the trivial components.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


Sometimes a scree plot will display several large breaks.  When this is the case, you should look
for the last big break before the eigenvalues begin to level off. Only the components that appear
before this last large break should be retained.

\subsubsection{Advantages and Disadvantages}
The scree test can be expected to provide reasonably accurate results, provided the sample is
large (over 200) and most of the variable communalities are large (Stevens, 1986).  However,
this criterion has its own weaknesses as well, most notably the ambiguity that is often displayed
by scree plots under typical research conditions:  Very often, it is difficult to determine exactly
where in the scree plot a break exists, or even if a break exists at all.

\subsection{The Eigenvalue-One Criterion} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item In principal component analysis, one of the most commonly
	used criteria for solving the number-of-components problem is the eigenvalue-one criterion, also
	known as the Kaiser criterion (Kaiser, 1960).  
	\item With this approach, you retain and interpret any
	component with an eigenvalue greater than 1.00.
	
	\item 	The rationale for this criterion is straightforward.  Each observed variable contributes one unit of
	variance to the total variance in the data set.  Any component that displays an eigenvalue greater
	than 1.00 is accounting  for a greater amount of variance than had been contributed by one
	variable.  Such a component is therefore accounting for a meaningful amount of variance, and is
	worthy of being retained.
	
	\item 	On the other hand, a component with an eigenvalue less than 1.00 is accounting for less variance
	than had been contributed by one variable.  The purpose of principal component analysis is to
	reduce a number of observed variables into a relatively smaller number of components; this
	cannot be effectively achieved if you retain components that account for less variance than had
	been contributed by individual variables.  For this reason, components with eigenvalues less than
	1.00 are viewed as trivial, and are not retained.
\end{itemize} 
%====================================================%

\subsubsection{Advantages and Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The eigenvalue-one criterion has a number of positive features that have contributed to its
	popularity.  Perhaps the most important reason for its widespread use is its simplicity:  You do
	not make any subjective decisions, but merely retain components with eigenvalues greater than
	one.
	
	\item 	On the positive side, it has been shown that this criterion very often results in retaining the
	correct number of components, particularly when a small to moderate number of variables are
	being analyzed and the variable communalities are high.  Stevens (1986) reviews studies that
	have investigated the accuracy of the eigenvalue-one criterion, and recommends its use when
	less than 30 variables are being analyzed and communalities are greater than .70, or when the
	analysis is based on over 250 observations and the mean communality is greater than or equal to
	0.60.
	
	\item 	There are a number of problems associated with the eigenvalue-one criterion, however.  As was
	suggested in the preceding paragraph, it can lead to retaining the wrong number of components
	under circumstances that are often encountered in research (e.g., when many variables are
	analyzed, when communalities are small).
	
	\item 	Also, the mindless application of this criterion can
	lead to retaining a certain number of components when the actual difference in the eigenvalues
	of successive components is only trivial.  For example, if component 2 displays an eigenvalue of
	1.001 and component 3 displays an eigenvalue of 0.999, then component 2 will be retained but
	component 3 will not; this may mislead you into believing that the third component was
	meaningless when, in fact, it accounted for almost exactly the same amount of variance as the
	second component.
	
	\item 	In short, the eigenvalue-one criterion can be helpful when used judiciously,
	but the thoughtless application of this approach can lead to serious errors of interpretation.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Total Variance in the context of PCA}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To understand the meaning of \textbf{total
		variance} as it is used in a principal component analysis, remember that the observed
	variables are standardized in the course of the analysis.  This means that each variable is
	transformed so that it has a mean of zero and a variance of one.
	
\item 	The total variance in the
	data set is simply the sum of the variances of these observed variables.  Because they have
	been standardized to have a variance of one, each observed variable contributes one unit of
	variance to the total variance in the data set.  Because of this, the total variance in a
	principal component analysis \textbf{\emph{will always be equal}} to the number of observed variables
	being analyzed.
	
\item 	For example, if seven variables are being analyzed, the total variance will
	equal seven.  The components that are extracted in the analysis will partition this variance:
	perhaps the first component will account for 3.2 units of total variance; perhaps the second
	component will account for 2.1 units.  The analysis continues in this way until all of the
	variance in the data set (i.e. the remaining 1.7 units). has been accounted for.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Proportion of Variance Accounted For}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A third criterion in solving the number of factors
	problem involves retaining a component if it accounts for a specified proportion (or percentage)
	of variance in the data set. 
	\item For example, you may decide to retain any component that accounts
	for at least $5\%$ or $10\%$ of the total variance.  This proportion can be calculated with a simple
	formula:
	
	\[ \mbox{Proportion}  = \frac{\mbox{Eigenvalue for the component of interest}}{\mbox{Total eigenvalues of the correlation matrix}}  \]
	
	\item 	In principal component analysis, the total eigenvalues of the correlation matrix is equal to the
	total number of variables being analyzed (because each variable contributes one unit of variance
	to the analysis).
	
	\item 	An alternative criterion is to retain enough components so that the cumulative percent of variance
	accounted for is equal to some minimal value.  Suppose that,in a PCA procedure, that components 1, 2, 3,
	and 4 accounted for approximately $37\%$, $33\%$, $13\%$, and $10\%$ of the total variance, respectively.
	
	\item 	Suppose that it was required to account for $90\%$ of the variance. Adding these percentages together results in a sum of $93\%$.  This means that the cumulative percent of variance accounted for by components 1, 2, 3, and 4 is $93\%$.
\end{itemize}

	\end{center}
	
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Advantages and Disadvantages}

The proportion of variance criterion has a number of positive features.  For example, in most
cases, you would not want to retain a group of components that, combined, account for only a
minority of the variance in the data set (say, $30\%$).  Nonetheless, many critical values discussed
earlier are obviously arbitrary.  Because of these and related problems, this approach has sometimes been
criticized for its subjectivity (Kim and Mueller, 1978).

\subsection{The Interpretability Criteria}

Perhaps the most important criterion for solving the \textbf{\emph{number of-components}} problem is the interpretability criterion:  interpreting the substantive meaning of the retained components and verifying that this interpretation makes sense in terms of what is known about the constructs under investigation.


The following list provides four rules to follow in doing this.  (A later section shows how to
actually interpret the results of a principal component analysis; the following rules will be more
meaningful after you have completed that section).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Are there at least three variables (items) with significant loadings on each retained
	component?  A solution is less satisfactory if a given component is measured by less than
	three variables.
	
	\item  Do the variables that load on a given component share the same conceptual meaning?
	For example, if three questions on a survey all load on component 1, do all three of these
	questions seem to be measuring the same construct?
	
	\item  Do the variables that load on different components seem to be measuring different
	constructs?  For example, if three questions load on component 1, and three other
	questions load on component 2, do the first three questions seem to be measuring a
	construct that is conceptually different from the construct measured by the last three
	questions?
	
	\item  Does the rotated factor pattern demonstrate simple structure?  Simple structure
	means that the pattern possesses two characteristic:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(a)] Most of the variables have
		relatively high factor loadings on only one component, and near zero loadings on the other
		components, and \item[(b)] most components have relatively high factor loadings for some
		variables, and near-zero loadings for the remaining variables.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
