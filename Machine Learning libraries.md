Machine Learning libraries
==================================
- nn - Neural Network package for Torch
- nngraph - This package provides graphical computation for nn library in Torch7.
- nnx - A completely unstable and experimental package that extends Torch's builtin nn library
- optim - An optimization library for Torch. SGD, Adagrad, Conjugate-Gradient, LBFGS, RProp and more.
- unsup - A package for unsupervised learning in Torch. Provides modules that are compatible with nn (LinearPsd, ConvPsd, AutoEncoder, ...), and self-contained algorithms (k-means, PCA).
- manifold - A package to manipulate manifolds
- svm - Torch-SVM library
- lbfgs - FFI Wrapper for liblbfgs
- vowpalwabbit - An old vowpalwabbit interface to torch.
- OpenGM - OpenGM is a C++ library for graphical modeling, and inference. The Lua bindings provide a simple way of describing graphs, from Lua, and then optimizing them with OpenGM.
- sphagetti - Spaghetti (sparse linear) module for torch7 by @MichaelMathieu
- LuaSHKit - A lua wrapper around the Locality sensitive hashing library SHKit
- kernel smoothing - KNN, kernel-weighted average, local linear regression smoothers
