Properties of ROC Curves
================================
An ROC curve demonstrates several things:
1. It shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specicity (any increase
in sensitivity will be accompanied by a decrease in specicity).
2. The closer the curve follows the upper-left border of the ROC space,
the more accurate the test.
3. The closer the curve comes to the 45-degree diagonal of the ROC space,
the less accurate the test.
4. The slope of the tangent line at a cutpoint gives the likelihood ratio
(LR) for that value of the test.
5. The area under the curve is a measure of accuracy.
