Big Data Governance
=========================

The key aspects of a Big Data platform are:

- ***1. Integration*** — the point is to have one platform to manage all of the data. There’s no point in
having separate silos of data, each creating separate silos of insight. From the customer pointof-view
(a solution POV) big data has to be bigger than just one technology

- ***2. Analytics*** — a very important point. We see big data as a viable place to analyze and store data.
New technology is not just a pre-processor to get data into a structured data warehouse (DW)
for analysis. Deep analytics is a significant area of value add by IBM – and the game has
changed – unlike DBs/SQL, the market is asking who gets the better answer and therefore
sophistication and accuracy of the analytics matters

- ***3. Visualization*** — need to bring big data to the users — for example, a spreadsheet metaphor is
well known technological approach understood by business users

- ***4. Development*** — need sophisticated development tools for the engines and across them to
enable the market to develop analytic applications

- ***5. Workload optimization*** — improvements upon open source for efficient processing and storage

- ***6. Security and Governance*** — many are rushing into big data like the wild west. But there is
sensitive data that needs to be protected, retention policies need to be determined — all of the
maturity of governance for the structured world can benefit the big data world
