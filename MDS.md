MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING
=====================================
- **Multidimensional scaling (MDS)** is a set of data analysis techniques that display the structure of distance-like data as a geometrical picture. It is an extension of the procedure discussed in SCALING.

- MDS has its origins in psychometrics. where it was proposed to help understand people's judgments of the similarity of members of a set of objects. Torgerson [18] proposed the first MDS method and coined the term. his work evolving from that of Richardson [11]. 
- MDS has now become a general data analysis technique used in a wide variety of fields [14]. For example, the book on theory and applications of MDS by Young and Hamer, [21] presents applications of MDS in such diverse fields as marketing'. sociology, physics, political science', and biology. However, we limit our examples here to the field with which the author is most familiar, psychology.

- MDS pictures the structure of a set of objects from data that approximate the distances between pairs of the objects. The data, which are called similarities. dissimilarities, distances, or proximities, must reflect the amount of (dissimilarity between pairs of the. 
- In this article we use the term similarity generically to refer to both similarities (where large numbers refer to great similarity) and to dissimilarities (where large numbers refer to great dissimilarity).

- In addition to the traditional human similarity judgment, the data can be an "objective" similarity measure (the driving time between pairs of cities) or an index calculated from multivariate data (the proportion of agreement in the votes cast by pairs of senators). However, the data must always I represent the degree of similarity of pairs of objects (or events).

- Each object or event is represented by a point in a multidimensional space. The points are arranged in this space so that the distances between pairs of points have the strongest possible relation to the similarities among the pairs of objects. That is, two similar objects are represented by two points that are close together, and two dissimilar objects are represented by two points that are far apart. The space is usually a two- or three-dimensional Euclidean space, but may be non-Euclidean and may have more dimensions.

- MDS is a generic term that includes many different specific types. These types can be classified according to whether the similarities data are qualitative (called ***nonmetric MDS***) or quantitative (***metric MDS***). The number of similarity matrices and the nature of the MDS model can also classify MDS types. 

- This classification yields classical MDS (one matrix, unweighted model), replicated MDS (several matrices, unweighted model), and weighted MDS (several matrices, weighted model). We discuss the nonmetric-metric and the classical-replicated-weighted classifications in the following sub-sections.
