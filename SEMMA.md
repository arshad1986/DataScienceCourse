SEMMA Methodology (SAS)
==============================
SEMMA is an acronym that stands for Sample, Explore, Modify, Model and Assess. It is a list of sequential steps developed by SAS Institute Inc., one of the largest producers of statistics and business intelligence software. It guides the implementation of data mining applications.

Although SEMMA is often considered to be a general data mining methodology, SAS claims that it is "rather a logical organisation of the functional tool set of" one of their products, SAS Enterprise Miner, "for carrying out the core tasks of data mining".

- *Sample* : Sample from Data Sets, Partition into training, validation and test data sets
- *Explore* : Explore Data Sets statistically and graphically
- *Modify* : Transform variables, impute missing values
- *Model* : Fit models eg. regression, classification tre, neural net
- *Assess* :  Compare models using partition Test data sets

### Criticism
SEMMA mainly focuses on the modeling tasks of data mining projects, leaving the business aspects out (unlike, i.e., CRISP-DM and its Business Understanding phase). 

Additionally, SEMMA is designed to help the users of the SAS Enterprise Miner software. Therefore, applying it outside Enterprise Miner can be ambiguous.]
