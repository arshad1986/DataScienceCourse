#### Fisher's Linear Discriminant

- Discriminant Analysis is a technique for classifying a set of observaations into predefined classes.
- The purpose is to determine the class of an observation based on a set of variables (predictor variables)
- The model is built based on a set of observations for which the classes are known, called a training set, discriminant functions are then derived.

- This discriminant function is then used to predict the class of a new observationb with unknown class.
