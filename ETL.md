Extract, transform and load (ETL)
=====================================

Extract, transform and load (ETL) is the core process of data integration and
is typically associated with data warehousing. ETL tools extract data from a chosen source(s), 
transform it into new formats according to business rules, and then load it into target data structure(s). 

Managing rules and processes for the increasing diversity of data sources and high volumes of data processed 
that ETL must accommodate, make management, performance and cost the primary and challenges for users. 
The traditional ETL approach requires users to map each physical data item with a unique metadata description; 
newer ETL tools allow the user to create an abstraction layer of common business definitions and map all similar 
data items to the same definition before applying target-specific business rules, 
isolating business rules from data and allowing easier ETL management.
