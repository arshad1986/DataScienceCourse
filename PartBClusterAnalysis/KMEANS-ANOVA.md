The ANOVA table indicates which variables contribute the most to your cluster solution.
Variables with large F values provide the greatest separation between clusters. 





Distances between Final Cluster Centers
This table shows the Euclidean distances between the final cluster centers. Greater
distances between clusters correspond to greater dissimilarities.
• Clusters 1 and 3 are most different.
• Cluster 2 is approximately equally similar to clusters 1 and 3.
These relationships between the clusters can also be intuited from the final cluster
centers, but this becomes more difficult as the number of clusters and variables
increases.
