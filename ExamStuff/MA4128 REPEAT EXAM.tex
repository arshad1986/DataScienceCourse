\section*{Attempt All Questions}




\subsection*{Question 1 : Cluster Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item[i.](2 Marks) What is the purpose of a cluster analysis?

\item[ii.](2 Marks)  A discriminant analysis is similar to a cluster analysis; however, there is one fundamental difference.  Explain this difference.

\item[iii.](2 Marks)  Compare and contrast any two linkage methods.

\item[iv.](2 Marks)  What is the difference between a linkage method and a distance measure?

\item[iv.](2 Marks)  Compare and contrast any two linkage methods.

\item[v.](2 Marks)  How do we determine the appropriate number of clusters?  Give two different visualization methods that are used to display the outcome of a cluster analysis.
%\item[vi.](2 Marks)  Compare and contrast agglomerative and divisive clustering.

\item[vi.](2 Marks)  Compute the Euclidean distance between the following points.
\[ A = \c(4,7,8,2)\]
\[ B = \c(5,6,2,6)\]

\item[vii.](2 Marks)  Give one reason why the squared Euclidean Distance may be used in preference to the Euclidean distance.

%\item[7.] Vertical Icicle Plot
\end{itemize}
%-----------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{itemize}
\item[viii.](2 Marks)  In the context of hierarchical cluster analysis, distinguish between agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering.
\item[ix.](2 Marks)  What is a vertical icicle plot used for? Give a brief description, supporting your answer with sketches.
\item[x.](2 Marks)  Explain the difference between Ward's method and k means
 clustering.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
%\subsection*{Question 3 :k-means cluster analysis}
%Use two clusters.
%Illustrate your answer with sketches.
\subsection*{Question 2a : Dimensionality Reduction}
The following questions relate to Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis
\begin{itemize}

\item[i.](2 Marks)	What is the purpose of a principal component analysis?
\item[ii.](3 Mark) Varimax, quartimax and equamax are the commonly used methods in a certain procedure.
What is this procedure? What is the purpose of the procedure. Which method is the
most commonly used?
\item[iii.](5 Marks)	What is meant by the ``true" dimension of the data?  How does an analyst determine the appropriate number of principal components to retain, making reference to three different approaches.
\item[iv.](2 Marks)	What problems occur if a principal component analysis is carried out on a data matrix where the columns contain measurements on very difference scales?  What can be done to overcome this problem?

\item[v.](2 Marks) The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic is used to measure a certain characteristic of the data. What is this characteristic? Explain how the KMO statistic should be interpreted.
\item[vi.](1 Marks) Briefly describe the Bartlett Test for Sphericity, with reference to the null and alternative hypotheses, and how those statements relate to the purpose of the test.


\end{itemize}

\item[i.](1 Mark) Define multicollinearity.
\item[ii.](2 Marks) State two ways in which a multiple regression analysis could be affected by severe
multicollinearity.
\item[iii.](2 Marks) State two ways of formally diagnosing the severity of multicollinearity, making reference to how both should be used to make decisions about the data.
%\item[iv.] Describe two statistical methods that can be applied to the data to lessen the effects of
%severe multicollinearity.
