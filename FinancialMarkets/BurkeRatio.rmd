BurkeRatio 
====================================
Burke ratio of the return distribution

### Description
To calculate Burke ratio we take the difference between the portfolio return and the risk free rate
and we divide it by the square root of the sum of the square of the drawdowns. To calculate the
modiﬁed Burke ratio we just multiply the Burke ratio by the square root of the number of datas.

### Usage
BurkeRatio(R, Rf = 0, modified = FALSE, ...)

#### Arguments
- R an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of asset returns
- Rf the risk free rate
- modified a boolean to decide which ratio to calculate between Burke ratio and modiﬁed Burke ratio.
- ... any other passthrough parameters
