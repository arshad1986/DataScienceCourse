The Sortino Ratio
================================
The Sortino Ratio is calculated as S = (R-T)/DR

where
- R is the asset or portfolio average realized return; 
- T is the target or required rate of return for the investment strategy under consideration,   
(T was originally known as the minimum acceptable return, or MAR); 
- DR is the target semi-deviation (the square root of target semivariance) and is termed downside deviation.

The Sortino Ratio is expressed in percentages and therefore allows for rankings in the same way as standard deviation.
