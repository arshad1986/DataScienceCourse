The Sterling Ratio
==================================
The Sterling Ratio (SR) is a measure of the risk-adjusted return of an investment portfolio.

Multiple definitions of the Sterling ratio exist. 
The original definition was most likely suggested by Deane Sterling Jones:

$$SR=\frac{Annual\ Portfolio\ Return}{Average\ Largest\ Drawdown + 10\%}$$

The Calmar Ratio
==================================

The Calmar ratio is another method of creating a risk-adjusted measure for ranking
investments.

### Usage
 > CalmarRatio(R, scale = NA)
 > SterlingRatio(R, scale = NA, excess = 0.1)
