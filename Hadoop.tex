Hadoop
Starts October 2015
About the Course
Are you looking for hands-on experience analyzing big data?   After completing this course, you will be able to install, configure and implement an Apache Hadoop stack ranging from basic "Big Data" components to MapReduce and Spark execution frameworks. Moreover, the hands-on exercises in this course require more computing power than a personal computer. So you will use  distributed/parallel processing systems to better manipulate and understand the significance of your own data.
