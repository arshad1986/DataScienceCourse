#### Question  1. 
Which of the following is the best description of why it is important to learn about the foundations in big data?

* Understanding of practical concepts in Hadoop allows solid foundation.
* Foundations stand the test of time.
* ***Foundations allow understanding of practical concepts in Hadoop.*** [Correct Response ]
* Since foundations can be retained for a long time, Hadoop should be learned.
