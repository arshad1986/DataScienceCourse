Association rule learning              
=========================

- Association rule learning enables the discovery of interesting relations (interdependencies) between different variables in large databases. Association rule learning uncovers hidden patterns in the data that can be used to identify variables within the data and the co-occurrences of different variables that appear with the greatest frequencies.

- Association rule learning is often used in the retail industry when finding patterns in point-of-sales data. 
- These patterns can be used when recommending new products to others based on what others have bought before or based on which products are bought together. If this is done correctly, it can help organisations increase their conversion rate. A well-known example is that thanks to data mining, Walmart, already in 2004, discovered that Strawberry Pop-tarts sales increase by seven times prior to a hurricane. Since this discovery, Walmart places the Strawberry Pop-Tarts at the checkouts prior to a hurricane.
