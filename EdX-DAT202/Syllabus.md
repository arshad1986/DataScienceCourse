Coursework and Grading
This course includes coursework, some of which is graded. Each module in the
course includes an ungraded lab (which is designed to give you hands-on practice
with the Hadoop technologies taught in the module), and a graded assessment, in
which you must answer all questions. Additionally, at the end of the course you
must complete a final exam.
The module assessments account for 50% of the total grading for the course, and
the final exam accounts for the remaining 50%. You must achieve an overall score
of 70% or more to pass this course.
In the module assessments, you have two attempts at each question. In the final
exam, you are restricted to one attempt per question.

####Discussion
We encourage all students to submit questions, observations, and comments in
the Discussion section. If you have any issues while working on the course, check
here first – your fellow students may have already found a resolution!

Please remember that the discussion forum is open to all students and staff, and
while we love to see passionate engagement, abusive or inflammatory behavior
will not be tolerated.

Due to the volume of students attending this course, it will not be possible for the
course staff to answer every question individually. You should still post questions
however, because in many cases, your fellow students may be able to help.
