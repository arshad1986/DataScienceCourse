Accessing Hadoop Data Using Hive
=======================================================

Writing map/reduce programs to analyze your Big Data can get complex. Hive can help make querying your data much easier. Apache Hive, first created at Facebook, is a data warehouse system for Hadoop that facilitates easy data summarization, ad-hoc queries, and the analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop compatible file systems. Hive provides a mechanism to project structure onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like language called HiveQL. 
This course will teach you how to get started with Hive 0.12 using IBM BigInsights 2.1.2.
