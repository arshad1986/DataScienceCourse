Overdispersion
============================

Overdispersion is an important concept in the analysis of discrete data. Many a time data admit more variability than expected under the assumed distribution. The greater variability than predicted by the generalized linear model random component reflects overdispersion. Overdispersion occurs because the mean and variance components of a GLM are related and depends on the same parameter that is being predicted through the independent vector.

### Reasons for overdispersion
- Overdispersion can be explained by
 - variation among the success probabilities or
 - correlation between the binary responses
- Both reasons are the same, since variation leads to correlation and vice versa.
- But for interpretative reasons one explanation might be more reasonable than the other.
