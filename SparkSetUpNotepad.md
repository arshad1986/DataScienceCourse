WHAT APACHE SPARK DOES
====================
Apache Spark is a fast, in-memory data processing engine with elegant and expressive development APIs to allow data workers to efficiently execute streaming, machine learning or SQL workloads that require fast iterative access to datasets. With Spark running on Apache Hadoop YARN, developers everywhere can now create applications to exploit Sparkâ€™s power, derive insights, and enrich their data science workloads within a single, shared dataset in Hadoop.
