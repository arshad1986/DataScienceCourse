\section*{Apache Mahout}
Apache Mahout is an Apache project to produce free implementations of distributed or otherwise scalable machine learning algorithms on the Hadoop platform. Mahout is a work in progress; the number of implemented algorithms has grown quickly but there are still various algorithms missing.
While Mahout's core algorithms for clustering, classification and batch based collaborative filtering are implemented on top of Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm, it does not restrict contributions to Hadoop based implementations. Contributions that run on a single node or on a non-Hadoop cluster are  welcomed. For example, the 'Taste' collaborative-filtering recommender component of Mahout was originally a separate project and can run stand-alone without Hadoop. 
\begin{itemize}	
\item	Collaborative Filtering
\item	User and Item based recommenders
\item	K-Means, Fuzzy K-Means clustering
\item	Mean Shift clustering
\item	Dirichlet process clustering
\item	Latent Dirichlet Allocation
\item	Singular value decomposition
\item	Parallel Frequent Pattern mining
\item	Complementary Naive Bayes classifier
\item	Random forest decision tree based classifier
\end{itemize}
