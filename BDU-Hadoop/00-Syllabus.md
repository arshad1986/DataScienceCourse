Hadoop Fundamentals I teaches you the basics of Apache Hadoop and the concept of Big Data. 

The materials and software used in this course are all FREE!. This is the forth version of this course. Since Version 2 was published, several more detailed courses covering topics such as MapReduce, Hive, HBase, Pig, Oozie, and Zookeeper have been added.  We recommend you start here and then dig deeper into the specific Hadoop technology you wish to learn more about.

This course is designed to give you a basic understanding of Hadoop.  It first begins with describing what is Big Data and the need for Hadoop to be able to process that data in a timely manner. This is followed by describing the Hadoop architecture and how to work with the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

After describing Hadoop's architecture, Hadoop administration is covered. Here the course covers adding and removing nodes from a Hadoop cluster, checking the amount of disk space available on each node, and how to modify the various Hadoop configuration parameters

The course ends with overviews of some of the other open source products using in a Hadoop cluster. Only highlights are given about MapReduce, Pig, Jaql, Hive, Flume, Sqoop, and Oozie.There are other courses on the Big Data University that cover these products in more detail.
