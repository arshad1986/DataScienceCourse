Classification analysis
==========================
- Classification Analysis is a systematic process for obtaining important and relevant information about data, and metadata â€“ data about data. The classification analysis helps identifying to which of a set of categories different types of data belong. Classification analysis is closely linked to cluster analysis as the classification can be used to cluster data.

- Your email provider performs a well-known example of classification analysis: they use algorithms that are capable of classifying your email as legitimate or mark it as spam. This is done based on data that is linked with the email or the information that is in the email, for example certain words or attachments that indicate spam.
