Specificity (TNR) is the proportion of people that tested negative (TN) of all the people that actually are negative (TN+FP). As with sensitivity, it can be looked at as the probability that the test result is negative given that the patient is not sick. With higher specificity, fewer healthy people are labeled as sick (or, in the factory case, the less money the factory loses by discarding good products instead of selling them).

Sensitivity (TPR), also known as recall, is the proportion of people that tested positive (TP) of all the people that actually are positive (TP+FN). It can be seen as the probability that the test is positive given that the patient is sick. With higher sensitivity, fewer actual cases of disease go undetected (or, in the case of the factory quality control, the fewer faulty products go to the market).

The relationship between sensitivity and specificity, as well as the performance of the classifier, can be visualized and studied using the ROC curve.
