The TwoStep Cluster Analysis
TwoStep Cluster is an algorithm primarily designed to analyze large datasets. The algorithm
groups the observations in clusters, using the approach criterion2
. The procedure uses an
agglomerative hierarchical clustering method3
. Compared to classical methods of cluster
analysis, TwoStep enables both continuous and categorical attributes. Moreover, the method can
automatically determine the optimal number of clusters.
TwoStep Cluster involves performing the following steps:
o pre-clustering;
o solving atypical values (outliers) - optional;
o clustering.
In the pre-clustering step, it scans the data record one by one and decides whether the current
record can be added to one of the previously formed clusters or it starts a new cluster, based on
the distance criterion4
. The method uses two types of distance measuring: Euclidian distance
and log-likelihood distance5
.
Pre-clustering procedure is implemented by building a data structure called CF (cluster feature)
tree, which contains the cluster centers. The CF tree consists of levels of nodes, each node
having a number of entries. A leaf entry is a final sub-cluster. For each record, starting from the
root node, the nearest child node is found recursively, descending along the CF tree. Once
reaching a leaf node, the algorithm finds the nearest leaf entry in the leaf node. If the record is
within a threshold distance of the nearest leaf entry, then the record is added into the leaf entry
and the CF tree is updated. Otherwise, it creates a new value for the leaf node. If there is enough
