Question 2
True or false: if the dataset is linearly separable, then it is possible for the number of classification errors to increase during learning.

True			
False	Inorrect	0.00

Question Explanation

One training case might send the parameters off in a bad direction, that suddenly makes the perceptron misclassify many other training cases, before it finds a parameter setting that works for all training cases.
Question 3
True or false: If a generously feasible region exists, then the distance between the current weight vector and any weight vector in the feasible region will monotonically decrease as the learning proceeds.

Question Explanation

If a generously feasible region exists then the problem is linearly separable, however it is not true that the distance between the current weight vector and a vector that is merely in the feasible region will monotonically decrease as the learning proceeds. It is possible to verify this using the program.
Question 4
The perceptron algorithm as implemented and described in class implicitly uses a learning rate of 1. We can modify the algorithm to use a different learning rate α so that the update rule for an input x and target t becomes: 
w(t)←w(t−1)+α(t−prediction)x, 
where prediction is the decision made by the perceptron using the current weight vector w(t−1), given by: 
prediction={1 if wTx≥00 otherwise 
True or false: if we use a learning rate of 2, then the perceptron algorithm will always converge to a solution for linearly separable datasets.

Question Explanation

This is equivalent to doubling the magnitude of each training example, which will not change the fact that the dataset is still linearly separable.
Question 5
According to the code, how many iterations does it take for the perceptron to converge to a solution on dataset 3 using the provided initial weight vector w_init? 
Note: the program will output
Number of errors in iteration x:	0
You simply need to report x.
