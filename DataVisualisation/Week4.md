Week 4 Quiz
=========================

#### Question 1. 
When creating an overview visualization of a large dataset, it is most important to:

* Pack as many details as possible into the display to be as efficient and informative as possible

* Display only an important subset of the datapoints so as to not overwhelm the user

* ***CORRECT*** Display all of the data using a simple representation and axes that spread the data out as much as possible

-----------------------------------------------------

#### Question 2. 
The process of zooming on the data plotted in a visualization, where the zoomed region then fills the entire display:

* Is an important part of Schneiderman's information visualization mantra

* Provides focus on the zoomed portion of the data

* Is actually a filtering operation on the display coordinates of the plotted data

* CORRECT ***All of the above***

* None of the above

--------------------------------------------------

#### Question 3. 
The goal of the filtering step of the information visualization mantra is to:

* Remove outliers

* Smooth noisy data

* CORRECT ***Display a subset***

--------------------------------------------------

#### Question 4. 
Which of the following benefits of a fisheye lens is LEAST important for data visualization?

* CORRECT ***It makes the data appear more interesting.***

* It supports focus on detail along with the context of that detail amid the rest of the dataset.

* It allows zooming without obscuring the unzoomed data.


--------------------------------------------------

#### Question 5. 
Suppose we have a dataset representing an image consisting of pixel records of the form (x,y,b) where x and y are the spatial coordinates of the pixel and b is the brightness of the pixel. Then, which of the following provides the best histogram of the data?

* WRONG A subdivision of the image's (x,y) coordinates into regions, plotting an average pixel brightness for each region

* WRONG A plot of the average pixel brightness over the y axis, of all pixels that share the same x coordinate

* A subdivision of the image's brightness values into ranges, plotting the count of the pixels whose brightness is in each range

--------------------------------------------------

#### Question 6. 
Suppose we have a dataset representing an image consisting of pixel records of the form (x,y,b) where x and y are the spatial coordinates of the pixel and b is the brightness of the pixel. Then, which of the following represents a "rollup" of the x and y dimensions of this dataset?

* CORRECT ***The average brightness of the image***

* The position of the center of the image

* None of the above

--------------------------------------------------

#### Question 7. 
Suppose we have a dataset representing an image consisting of pixel records of the form (x,y,b) where x and y are the spatial coordinates of the pixel and b is the brightness of the pixel. Which axis definition would we NOT use if we wanted to plot the pixel brightness at a unique axis location for every pixel in the image?

* An axis formed by nesting the x dimension under the y dimension

* WRONG  An axis formed by the product of the x dimension and the y dimension

* CORRECT An axis formed by the concatenation of the x dimension and the y dimension

--------------------------------------------------

#### Question 8. 
When designing a dashboard visualization, what should the primary concern be?

* CORRECT That the dashboard visualization presents all of the data necessary to make an informed decision

* That the dashboard visualization engages the user to motivate further study of the data

* WRONG That the dashboard provide a simple overview of all the data, without any distracting details
