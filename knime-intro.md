KNIME, the Konstanz Information Miner, is an open source data analytics, reporting and integration platform. KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept. A graphical user interface allows assembly of nodes for data preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling and data analysis and visualization.

Since 2006, KNIME has been used in pharmaceutical research,[1] but is also used in other areas like CRM customer data analysis, business intelligence and financial data analysis.

Knime is a java open-source, cross-platform application which name means "Konstanz Information Miner". It is actually used extensively for data mining, data analysis and optimization. It can be downloaded as the core application itself(Knime Desktop), or the whole SDK which is based on Eclipse Helios. The knime software can also work with different kinds of extensions which are embedded into the "/downloads/extensions" tabs of the website.

\section{KNIME}

The Konstanz Information Miner, is a visual platform for graphically building and editing workflows and data analysis pipelines from defined components called nodes. KNIME is developed by Prof. Michael Berthold at the University of Konstanz, Germany.

It can be downloaded for free from www.knime.org .


KNIME is built on the Eclipse Interactive Development Environment and written in Java.

Versions are available for Windows, Linux and now the Macintosh. Another unique aspect to the KNIME workflow program is

the emphasis on chemistry and chemoinformatics through the incorporation of the CDK Chemistry project.


The standard data analysis and file manipulation tools that are distributed with KNIME include:

\begin{itemize}
\item I/O nodes to read and write data from files and databases
\item Data manipulation nodes to manage data in tables, like joining, filtering, partitioning, etc
\item Plotting and chart tools
\item Statistics and data mining tools, like clustering and machine learning
\end{itemize}
